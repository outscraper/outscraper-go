# Outscraper Go Library

The library provides convenient access to the [Outscraper API](https://app.outscraper.com/api-docs) from applications written in the Go language. Allows using [Outscraper's services](https://outscraper.com/services/) from your code.


## Installation

Make sure your project is using Go Modules (it will have a `go.mod` file in its
root if it already is):

``` sh
go mod init
```

Then, reference outscraper-go in a Go program with `import`:

``` go
import (
	"github.com/outscraper/outscraper-go/@v0.0.1"
)
```
